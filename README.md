### HRPG

![](hrpg.gif)

Yet another unfinished terminal game.

Yet another programming-while-creating experience.

This platform has had fine evolution. Character creation got fairly complete and customizable.

The `vars.js` file holds some clues of the game possibilities. All current setups are _foo demos_ for purpose of showcasing features. Adding elements (genders, races, traits, bodyParts, items, magic etc) to the game is a matter of setting up this file.

Game saving is server-side, but feel free to mess around.

Meant to be playable on mobile.

##### Unfinished means:

There is only one place, the store. There are no vehicles, so you can not got anywhere. There is no battle. There is no interaction. There is not a lot of things.

##### The game idea...

...was to create characters that would interact with each other, buy and sell many things, battle, go to places.

You would choose who you want to play 'as', and all other characters would turn into NPCs.

It would probably turn into an x-rated game. (Demo is adapted for safe text.)
